# AutoPhotometryReducer
Python program to handle reduction for SUNY Geneseo's photometric astronomy data.

v0.01

This program was written for the PowerPC Mac Pro in the astro research room. It likely
won't work as-is on Windows or Ubuntu (but you can try). If you are a new research student
it is in your best interest to not edit this program. I will keep a tarball of this program
as I last updated it on the RAID storage drive, so you may revert to that if something goes
really wrong.
